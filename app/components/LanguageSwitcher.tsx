 * Lives in the settings block at the foot of the menu drawer, not in the
 * header bar — see `LocalePreferences` in app/components/Header.tsx. The
 * drawer opens from the burger at every width, desktop included, which is
 * what keeps the settings reachable on a large screen.
 *
 * Submits to /locale, which stores the choice and redirects straight back to
 * the page the visitor is on — so switching language never costs them their
 * place. It is a form rather than a link because it writes a cookie, and a
 * link that changes state is a link a browser or a crawler may follow on its
 * own.
 *
 * It works without JavaScript: the same form posts and the same redirect
 * comes back. `useSubmit` only saves a click.
