/**
 * "Buy now": adds the line to the cart, then goes straight to the Shopify
 * checkout.
 *
 * The redirect is done by the server, not the browser. An earlier version
 * submitted through a fetcher and then set `window.location.href` once the
 * checkout URL came back — but navigating away mid-flight aborts React
 * Router's follow-up revalidation request, and Safari surfaces that abort as
 * `TypeError: Load failed`, which lands in the root error boundary. The
 * customer saw a 500 flash on the way to payment.
 *
 * `reloadDocument` makes this a plain browser form POST: no client-side fetch
 * to abort, and the action answers with a 303 to the checkout URL, which the
 * browser simply follows.
